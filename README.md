## What you will learn :white_check_mark:
Welcome and get excited to build your very first iOS game! The Hoppy Bunny tutorial will teach you how to implement
one of the most popular iOS games in ten sections. You will be cloning Flappy Bird using the Swift Programming Language
in the XCode environment. Specifically, you will get your first taste of SpriteKit, Apple's 2D game development framework.

Upon completing this tutorial, you will have learned how to:
- Implement infinite scrolling
- Implement procedural, random level generation
- Enabling and manipulating physics with SpriteKit

## Common issues :bug:
- Incorrect or Conflicting Z Position Values causes objects to disappear
- 'Optional' or 'Nil Value' errors can often be a result of missing code connections
- Unwanted interactions between different physics bodies may be a result of incorrect category / collision mask values

## What you should understand when finished :checkered_flag:
- Setting up the Scene: Importing Assets, Setting Z-Position, Creating new SKS files, Creating Frame Action Animations
- Configuring SKNode Physics: Static vs. Dynamic bodies, Reusing game elements with SKSReference Nodes, Toggling Gravity Property
- Adding Game Controls: Creating Class and Variable Code Connections, Implementing Touch Input, Controlling frams with the Update method, Applying Impulses to Physics Body
- Setting Up Collisions: Setting Category and Collision Bit Mask Values, Adding Physics Sensors, Defining Contact Delegates
- Adding Obstacles: Endless Generation, Random Placement
- Implement Scoring: Physics Sensor based Goals, Updating Labels
